### Todo version

**Collect** your ideas in a notebook.

Make quick **decision** : do now, do latter, delete, file...

**Plan** most important three things pre day/week.

**Do** one thing at one time.

Keep **simple** list and use simple tool.

**Organize**  incomming things in inbox and things to delegate or trash in outbox.

**Review** systems and goals weekly.

**Reduce** your goals and tasks to essentials.

Set and keep routine.

Seek for work which you're **passionate**.

### Not todo version

Not hesitate to your headlines.

No more than three things in priority B per day and priority C per week.

Not do multi-tasks.

Not let list complex and tool complex.

Don't put incomming and outcomming things everywhere.

Not to have no reivew time per week.

Not waste power on unessential things.

Not to have no reoutine habits.

Not sink into boring things.
